		<p class="project-description">Currently still a work in progress. Easy Books is my first attempt at utilizing open source api. I'm using Google Books api to create a solely nodeJS application that helps with keeping track of the multiple books I am reading and wish to read. Hopefully, it will also provide reading analytics, so I can improve my habits.</p>

		<p class="project-description">Type Chef is an interactive typing web application made during UofT Hacks 2017. The goal of this app was to solve the problem of today's generation. Not many people are proficient at typing and have a hard time cooking. We aimed to solve this problem by providing an application that trains typing and cooking knowledge through repetition. I was responsible for the frontend implementation. Github link can be found <a href='https://github.com/Wahat/super-broccoli' target="_blank">here.</a></p>
