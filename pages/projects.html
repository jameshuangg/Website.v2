		<img class="project-image" src="/images/typechef.jpg">
		<p>Type Chef is an interactive typing web application made during UofT Hacks 2017. The goal of this app was to solve the problem of today's generation. Not many people are proficient at typing and have a hard time cooking. We aimed to solve this problem by providing an application that trains typing and cooking knowledge through repetition.

		<p>TodoList is a simple web application made with the MEAN Stack. Through exposure to API endpoints at nanoPay, I gained an understanding of the MEAN stack through online tutorials and was able to develop a simple application that gets/posts/puts/deteles information from a local MongoDB.
