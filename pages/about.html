		<p>Hey. My name is James if you missed the title and I am a first year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
		<p>I absolutely love to learn, so much so, that if you ever see me. My face will probably be fixed to a computer screen or buried in a book. Besides learning, I also love to program things, pretend to be a food critic, and work out.</p>
		<p>I started seriously programming during 1st year university. I always had a connection to technology, but did not realize how powerful a medium code was to problem solving until recently. You can download my resume <a>here.</a></p>
